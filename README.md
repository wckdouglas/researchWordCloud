# researchWordCloud

These are the scripts that I used to produce the wordcloud in [my webpage](https://wckdouglas.github.io/research/).

Consist of:  
.txt files: the pdftotext files of my co-authored publications  
wordCount.py: python scripts to extract words into column  
wordCloud.R: plotting the wordcloud after removing all unwanted **words**  
wordclouds.sh: setup environment and make all things reproducible
